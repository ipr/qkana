Summary:
Experimenting with Qt, Berkeley DB and ways to translate given text 
(in hiragana, katakana and kanji) to english/finnish etc.

Description:
In progress..
Mostly just for personal use to learn japanese language and simple translation helper.

Some quick hacking to use dictionary files for help, namely EDICT (http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict.html),
possibly others later also (needs improvements in db-layout first).

Licensing:
BSD-style ? GPL v3 ? (to be determined..)

In progress, details later..
